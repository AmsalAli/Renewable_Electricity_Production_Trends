# Global Trends in Electricity Production from Renewable Sources, Excluding Hydroelectric (kWh)

This repository explores global trends in **electricity production from renewable sources, excluding hydroelectric**, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Sourced from the **World Bank**, this dataset provides insights into the growing adoption of renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, and geothermal.

## üåç Dataset Overview
- **Metric**: Electricity production from renewable sources (excluding hydroelectric) in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
- **Source**: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/)
- **Time Span**: Varies by country but spans multiple decades.
- **Geographical Coverage**: Worldwide.

## üìä Key Questions to Explore
1. Which countries produce the most electricity from non-hydro renewable sources?
2. How has renewable electricity production evolved globally over the decades?
3. What are the relationships between renewable electricity production and CO2 emissions or GDP?

## üöÄ Potential Applications
- **Energy Transition Analysis**: Understand the global shift toward non-hydro renewable energy.
- **Regional Comparisons**: Study disparities in renewable electricity production across countries.
- **Correlation Studies**: Explore the impact of renewable electricity production on CO2 emissions and economic indicators.

## üìà Sample Visualizations
- Line charts showing trends in renewable electricity production over time.
- Heatmaps highlighting disparities in renewable electricity production by region.
- Scatterplots correlating renewable electricity production with GDP or CO2 emissions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools for Analysis
